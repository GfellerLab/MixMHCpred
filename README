# MixMHCpred1.0 is a predictor of HLA ligand displayed at the cell surface.
# It was trained on naturally presented peptides coming from
# in-depth HLA peptidomics studies of unmodified cell lines and tissue samples.

INSTALLATION
############

For Mac:

1) Dowload the MixMHCpred1.0.zip file and move it to a directory
of your choice, where you have writing permissions.

2) Unzip the MixMHCpred1.0.zip package.

3) Open the MixMHCpred file and replace lib_path by the
path to the MixMHCpred1.0/lib directory where you have installed the script

4) To run it from anywhere on your computer, add the MixMHCpred1.0 directory to your path.

5) To test your installation, make sure you are inthe MixMHCpred1.0 directory and run the command:

   ./MixMHCpred -i test/test.fa -o test/out.txt -h A0101,A2501,B0801,B1801

Your file out.txt should be the same as test/out_compare.txt, except for
the fourth line that indicates the path of the input file and running
the script should take less than 5 seconds.
The test.fa file corresponds to all possible neo-antigens (i.e.,
9- and 10-mers containing one missense mutation) in Mel_5
melanoma sample (from Bassani-Sternberg et al. Nat Comm 2016).

- Do not use spaces in your file or directory names.
- Do not use other special characters (e.g., *, ?, %, &,...).

For Linux:

After step 3), you also need to compile the MixMHCpred.cc code. Go to
MixMHCpred1.0/lib and compile with your favorite C++ compiler
(e.g. c++ MixMHCpred.cc -o MixMHCpred.x)

Command:
MixMHCpred -i input_file -o output_file -h allele1,allele2

input_file:
File listing all the peptides. Ideally a fasta file, but text files
are supported and lines starting with ">" are simply skipped.
All peptides should be 9- or 10-mers.

allele:
HLA-I alleles. Use the simple nomenclature like A0101.
A01:01, A*01:01 or HLA-A*01:01 are also supported, but not
recommanded. If you want to make predictions with multiple
alleles, list the different alleles separated by a single comma ","
(e.g. -h A0101,A2501,B0801,B1801).

output_file:
The name of the output file.



#################
OTHER INFORMATION
#################

- MixMHCpred is meant for scoring different peptides and prioritizing
  the most likely HLA-I ligands. As it is trained on naturally presented
  peptides, it does not output a predicted affinity value, simply a score.

- The rank column in the output shows the rank of each peptide compared to all peptides provided in input.
  It is based on the maximum score across the alleles provided by the user.
  It can be used to prioritize peptides to be experimentally tested
  depending on the financial and technological means available in each lab.
 
- The p-value shows how likely it is to have a peptide with a given
  score (or higer) for the set of alleles given in input. It is computed based on
  a random sampling of 100,000 peptides from the human proteome.
  This P-value is simply an indicator of how
  a given peptide scores compared to a universe of random peptides. It
  should not be used as an indication of statistical significance or evolutionary pressure
  and does not include multiple testing corrections.
  Also, it is computed separately for 9-mers and 10-mers, which explains why it does not scale monotonously
  with the Max_score if you have a mixture of 9- and 10-mers.
  For this reason, we advise users to use the Max_score to rank predictions to be experimentally tested.
  
- The list of alleles is provided in MixMHCpred1.0/lib/pwm/allele_list.txt.
  The last column indicates whether the data to train our predictor come
  from deconvoluted HLA peptidomics studies with unmodified cell lines
  or tissue samples (1) or from mono-allelic cell lines [Abelin et al. Immunity (2017)] (2).
  If some alleles provided in input are not part of the
  list, you will not be able to make predictions for them (NA in the
 corresponding column in the output).
  
- The MixMHCpred1.0/tmp/ directory is used to store temporary files. Make
  sure there is no restriction for writing and reading files in this directory.

- Predictions of Cystein containing peptides are less reliable due to the low detection rate of Cys in MS.
  Given that Cystein can create many experimental issues with binding and immunogenicity assays,
  for practical applications, we advise to remove cysteine containing peptides from the list of peptides.
