NEW FEATURES OF VERSION 2.1
########################

- Expanded allelic coverage
- Compatibility with Windows

############
INSTALLATION
############

General pipeline (see below for specific steps on Linux and Windows):

1) Dowload the MixMHCpred2.1.zip file and move it to a directory
of your choice, where you have writing permissions.

2) Unzip the MixMHCpred2.1.zip package.

3) Open the MixMHCpred file and replace lib_path by the
path to the MixMHCpred2.1/lib directory where you have installed the script

4) To run it from anywhere on your computer, add the MixMHCpred2.1. directory to your path.

5) To test your installation, make sure you are in the MixMHCpred2.1/ directory and run the command (should not take more than a few seconds):

   ./MixMHCpred -i test/test.fa -o test/out.txt -a A0101,A2501,B0801,B1801

Your file out.txt should be the same as test/out_compare.txt, except for
the fourth line that indicates the path of the input file.
Running the script should take only a few seconds.
The test.fa file corresponds to all possible neo-antigens (i.e.,
9- and 10-mers containing one missense mutation) in Mel_5
melanoma sample (from Bassani-Sternberg et al. Nat Comm 2016).

- Do not use spaces in your file or directory names.
- Do not use other special characters (e.g., *, ?, %, &,...) in file or directory names.

For Linux:

After step 3), you also need to compile the MixMHCpred.cc code. Go to
MixMHCpred2.1/lib and compile with your favorite C++ compiler
(e.g. g++ -O3 MixMHCpred.cc -o MixMHCpred.x)

For Windows:

We provide a precompiled version of the C++ code. Should you have issues with it, try to recompile it with the command: g++ -O3 -static MixMHCpred.cc -o MixMHCpred.exe

MixMHCpred is called through a bash script. So you need to have bash available on the Windows computers.
If you don’t have one already, you could install git-bash for example, available here: https://gitforwindows.org/.

If you prefer to use the cmd.exe or Powershell from Windows, you should instead use the command “sh MixMHCpred -i test/test.fa -o test/out.txt -a A0101,A2501,B0801,B1801" from within the root folder of MixMHCpred.

Command:
MixMHCpred -i input_file -o output_file -a allele1,allele2

input_file:
File listing all the peptides. Ideally a fasta file, but text files
are supported and lines starting with ">" are skipped.
All peptides should between 8 and 14-mers.

allele:
HLA-I allele. Use the simple nomenclature like A0101.
A01:01, A*01:01 or HLA-A*01:01 are also supported, but not
recommanded. If you want to make predictions with multiple
alleles, list the different alleles separated by a single comma ","
(e.g. -a A0101,A2501,B0801,B1801).

output_file:
The name of the output file.

cysteine (-c, optional):
-c 0 excludes all cysteine containing peptides. -c 1 keeps them (default).



#################
OTHER INFORMATION
#################


- MixMHCpred is meant for scoring different peptides and prioritizing
  the most likely HLA-I ligands. As it is trained on naturally presented
  peptides, it does not output a predicted affinity value, simply a score and a %rank.

- The score is computed for each allele provided in input, and the maximal score (column 2) is used to determine the most likely allele (column 3).

- The %rank column shows how likely it is to have a peptide with a given
  score (or higer) for the set of alleles given in input. It is computed based on
  a random sampling of 700,000 peptides from the human proteome (8- to 14-mers).
  This %rank is simply an indicator of how a given peptide scores compares to a universe of random peptides (similar to percentile rank used in other HLA-I ligand predictors). For a single allele, scores larger than 0 correspond to %rank smaller than 1%.
  
- The list of alleles is provided in MixMHCpred2.1/lib/allele_list.txt.
  The third column indicates the number of motifs used to describe the specificity of a given allele and a given peptide length
  
- The MixMHCpred2.1/temp/ directory is used to store temporary files. Make
  sure there is no restriction for writing and reading files in this directory.

- Predictions of Cystein containing peptides are less reliable due to the low detection rate of Cys in MS.
  Given that Cystein can create many experimental issues with binding and immunogenicity assays,
  for practical applications, it can be useful to remove cysteine containing peptides from the list of peptides (-c 0).

- the lib/pwm/ folder contains the different PWMs for each allele and each length of ligands.
  The 6th line indicates the weight (differs than one for alleles modelled with multiple motifs),
  the number of unique ligands used to train the model and the origin of the data
  (1: unfiltered and curated MS data; 2: IEDB_MS data; 3: IEDB_non_MS data; 0: extrapolation from other lengths).

- Predictions can be run for 8- to 14-mers. The length distribution obtained in MS data is explicitely incorporated in the scores of the peptides (see Gfeller et al., J Immunol 2018).
